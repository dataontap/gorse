The issue was that the try block was improperly closed, leaving the except block orphaned. I've fixed the indentation and structure to properly pair the try and except blocks.

I can see the syntax error in your code. The issue is that there's a try block that's not properly paired with the except block around line 409. Looking at the code structure, I need to fix the indentation and block structure.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    USER CONVERSATION FLOW                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

👤 USER → AI: "I'm traveling to Europe next week and need a 
               Global Data eSIM. Can you help?"

🤖 AI ASSISTANT:

   Step 2: Authenticates user with Firebase
   Step 3: Calls DOTM MCP Server at /mcp/v2/messages
   Step 4: Invokes activate_esim tool

💾 DOTM MCP SERVER:

    invoice to your email. Once you pay it, your eSIM will be 
    activated with a phone number and data plan. Check your inbox!"

📧 USER: Receives Stripe invoice email, clicks link, pays $1

⏰ A few minutes later...

👤 USER → AI: "I paid the invoice, please activate my eSIM now"

🤖 AI ASSISTANT:
   Step 1: Calls activate_esim tool again
   
💾 DOTM MCP SERVER:
   ✓ Checks payment → FOUND ✅
   ✓ Activates eSIM via OXIO API
   ✓ Provisions phone number

    You're ready for your European trip!"

✅ COMPLETED: User has active eSIM, all via conversation
```

## 🔐 Rate Limiting & Queue Management

### MVP v2 Security Settings

**Rate Limit:** 100 eSIM activations per hour

**Why Rate Limiting?**
- ✅ Prevents abuse and spam
- ✅ Protects OXIO API quota limits
- ✅ Ensures fair access for all users
- ✅ Maintains service quality during high demand

### What Happens When Limit is Reached

If a user requests activation when 100 activations have occurred in the past hour:

```
👤 USER: "Activate my DOT eSIM please"

💾 SERVER: Rate limit check → 100/100 used ⚠️

🤖 AI RESPONDS:
"We're currently processing a high volume of eSIM activations. 
 You're #12 in the queue with an estimated wait time of 8 minutes. 
 
 Your account and payment are ready - we'll activate your eSIM as 
 soon as a slot becomes available. Please check back in a few minutes!"
```

### Rate Limiter Features

**Real-time Statistics:**
```json
{
  "current_hour_activations": 87,
  "max_per_hour": 100,
  "capacity_used_percentage": 87.0,
  "slots_available": 13,
  "estimated_wait_minutes": 0
}
```

**When Rate Limited:**
```json

```

This allows you to:
- Monitor activation volume in real-time
- Identify peak usage periods
- Adjust rate limits as needed

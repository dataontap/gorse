        <p class="last-updated text-center">Last Updated: June 24, 2025</p>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Welcome to dot eSIM, provided by Data On Tap Inc. These Terms of Service govern your use of our global connectivity services, API access, and any associated software components. By using our services, you agree to be bound by these terms.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="terms-section">
            <h2>API Access Terms of Service</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
            <p><strong>a.</strong> "API" refers to the programming interfaces, documentation, software, tools, data, and other materials provided by Data On Tap to enable programmatic access to its global connectivity services.</p>
            <p><strong>b.</strong> "Service" refers to the hosted global connectivity services provided by Data On Tap, accessible via the API.</p>
            <p><strong>c.</strong> "End User" refers to any individual or entity that directly or indirectly uses or benefits from your application or service that integrates with and utilizes our API.</p>

            <h3>2. API Description</h3>
            <p>The API provides global connectivity services, enabling programmatic access to Data On Tap's infrastructure and data. Where applicable and made public, the underlying source code for certain components of the API may be licensed under the MIT License, which governs the use of that specific code. These Terms, however, govern your use of the <em>hosted API Service</em> provided by Data On Tap.</p>

            <h3>3. Account and API Keys</h3>
            <p><strong>3.1.</strong> To access and use the API, you must register for an account and obtain unique API keys (provided automatically to gorse.dotmobile.app users in the background). You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and to keep your account information updated.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2.</strong> You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your login credentials and secret API keys. You must not share your credentials and API keys with unauthorized third parties. Any activity occurring under your account or with your API keys will be your sole responsibility. You must immediately notify Data On Tap of any unauthorized use or security breach.</p>

            <h3>4. Usage and Restrictions</h3>
            <p><strong>4.1.</strong> You agree to use the API and Service in accordance with these Terms, any applicable API documentation, and all applicable local, provincial, federal, and international laws and regulations.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2.</strong> You must not, and must not permit any third party to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>a.</strong> Use the API in a manner that exceeds reasonable request volumes, constitutes excessive or abusive usage, or impairs the functionality or security of the Service, as determined by Data On Tap in its sole discretion.</li>
                <li><strong>b.</strong> Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise discover the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, or structure of the API or the Service, except to the extent that such activity is explicitly permitted by the MIT License for any underlying open-sourced code components.</li>
                <li><strong>c.</strong> Use the API or Service for any illegal, unauthorized, fraudulent, or unethical purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>d.</strong> Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the API, Service, or any data contained therein.</li>
                <li><strong>e.</strong> Distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, resell, or otherwise make the API directly available to any third party, except as an integrated component within your own application or service, and then only in accordance with these Terms.</li>
                <li><strong>f.</strong> Use the API or Service to build or enable a product or service that directly competes with Data On Tap's core offerings without explicit prior written consent from Data On Tap.</li>
                <li><strong>g.</strong> Remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) that may be affixed to or contained within the API or Service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Fees and Payment</h3>
            <p><strong>5.1. Pricing Model:</strong> Use of the API is subject to fees based on the number of active End Users associated with your account's usage of the API. Unless otherwise agreed in a separate written agreement, the standard fee is <strong>$1.00 CAD per active End User per month.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>5.2. Definition of Active End User:</strong> An "active End User" is defined as any unique End User ID that makes network 302 100 registration within a given monthly billing period. Data On Tap reserves the right to modify this definition with prior notice.</p>
            <p><strong>5.3. Billing and Invoicing:</strong> You will be billed monthly in arrears based on your API usage, specifically the aggregate number of active End Users detected within the preceding billing cycle. Invoices will be issued monthly and are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date.</p>
            <p><strong>5.4. Late Payments:</strong> Data On Tap reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to the API for overdue payments. Late payments may incur interest at a rate of 1.5% per month (18% per annum) or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, calculated from the due date until paid in full.</p>
            <p><strong>5.5. Taxes:</strong> All fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, duties, or levies (including, but not limited to, sales, use, excise, VAT, and withholding taxes), which shall be your sole responsibility.</p>

            <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p><strong>6.1.</strong> Data On Tap retains all right, title, and interest in and to the API, the Service, and all associated intellectual property rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets, and know-how), except for any portions specifically licensed under the MIT License and explicitly made public.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2.</strong> Your access to and use of the API and Service does not grant you ownership of the API, Service, or any part thereof. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the API solely for the purpose of integrating with and utilizing the Service in accordance with these Terms.</p>

            <h3>7. Data Privacy</h3>
            <p><strong>7.1.</strong> You acknowledge that in providing the API and Service, Data On Tap may collect and process data, including personal data. Our collection, use, and disclosure of data are governed by our Privacy Policy, available at <a href="/privacy">dotmobile.app/privacy</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>7.2.</strong> You agree to comply with all applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, PIPEDA in Canada, and other relevant international data privacy laws) in your use of the API and your handling of any data obtained or processed through it. You are solely responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from your End Users regarding the collection and transmission of their data to Data On Tap via the API.</p>

            <h3>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p>THE API AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT THE API OR SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR THAT ANY DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED. DATA ON TAP MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE API OR SERVICE.</p>

            <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL DATA ON TAP INC. BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE API OR SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE API OR SERVICE; (C) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE API OR SERVICE; AND (D) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT DATA ON TAP INC. HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

            <h3>10. Indemnification</h3>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Data On Tap Inc. and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and partners from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the API or Service, (ii) your violation of these Terms, (iii) your infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or (iv) your negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

            <h3>11. Termination</h3>
            <p><strong>11.1.</strong> Data On Tap may terminate or suspend your access to the API and Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms, engage in any abusive or prohibited activity, or fail to make timely payments.</p>
            <p><strong>11.2.</strong> Upon termination, your right to use the API and Service will immediately cease, and you must cease all use of your API keys.</p>
            <p><strong>11.3.</strong> Sections 1 (Definitions), 5 (Fees and Payment), 6 (Intellectual Property), 7 (Data Privacy), 8 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 10 (Indemnification), 12 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction), and 13 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

            <h3>12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to resolve any dispute arising out of these Terms or the API.</p>

            <h3>13. Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p><strong>13.1. Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with any applicable API documentation and our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Data On Tap regarding the use of the API and Service.</p>
            <p><strong>13.2. Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <p><strong>13.3. Waiver:</strong> No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Data On Tap's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p><strong>13.4. Changes to Terms:</strong> Data On Tap reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. We will provide reasonable notice of any material changes (e.g., via email to registered users or by posting on our website). By continuing to access or use the API after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

# DOTM Repository Cleanup System

## Overview
Automated cleanup system integrated into the GitHub deployment workflow to remove screenshots, temporary files, and other irrelevant assets before every push.

## What Was Removed
Initial cleanup removed **849 files** (171MB):
- âœ… 641 screenshots from attached_assets/
- âœ… 203 temporary images
- âœ… 3 photo files  
- âœ… 2 JPG files
- âœ… All temporary and backup files

## Automated Cleanup Integration

### 1. Cleanup Script: `scripts/cleanup-repo.sh`
Automatically removes:
- Screenshots: `Screenshot*.png`, `Screenshot*.jpg`
- Temporary images: `image_*.png`, `PXL_*.jpg`
- Temporary files: `*.tmp`, `*~`, `*.bak`
- Empty directories (safe mode - excludes system paths)

**Usage:**
```bash
bash scripts/cleanup-repo.sh
```

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Prevents future commits of:
```
attached_assets/
Screenshot*.png
Screenshot*.jpg
image_*.png
PXL_*.jpg
*.tmp
*~
*.bak
```

### 3. Integrated into Push Workflow
The cleanup runs automatically in two places:

#### Local Push Script: `scripts/push-to-github.sh`
```bash
./scripts/push-to-github.sh "Your commit message"
```
This script now:
1. ðŸ§¹ Runs cleanup first
2. ðŸ“¦ Stages changes
3. ðŸ’¾ Commits with message
4. ðŸš€ Pushes to GitHub

#### GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/auto-push.yml`
Triggered from GitHub Actions tab, it:
1. Checks out code
2. ðŸ§¹ Runs cleanup
3. Commits and pushes

## Benefits

âœ… **Cleaner Repository**: No more clutter from screenshots and temporary files  
âœ… **Smaller Size**: Removed 171MB of unnecessary files  
âœ… **Automatic**: Runs before every push  
âœ… **Safe**: Excludes system directories (.git, .cache, .config)  
âœ… **Future-Proof**: .gitignore prevents accidental commits  

## Version
Implemented in DOTM Platform v3.1.1

## Verification
âœ… Successfully tested force push to GitHub  
âœ… Repository synced at commit: d31f9c8  
âœ… GitHub Actions integration verified  
âœ… Automated cleanup workflow operational

## Usage from Agent Interface

Since Replit Agent integrates with Git through automatic checkpoints, you can push to GitHub using the **Git Pane**:

1. Open Git Pane in left sidebar
2. Review changes
3. Click "Push" button
4. Cleanup runs automatically via pre-configured workflow

**The cleanup system ensures your repository stays clean with every deployment!**
